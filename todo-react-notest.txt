1. Installation
  yarn add typescript @types/node @types/react @types/react-dom @types/jest --dev
2. Rename .js and .jsx to .ts and .tsx
3. Migration strategy
  1. Set strict setting to false (tsconfig).
  2. Set 'noImplicitAny: false'
  2. Allow temporary 'any' and fix obvious errors for the compiler to pass.
  3. Once compiled, revert to strict true and noImplicitAny to true.
  4. Fix and add more types
